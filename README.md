# rate-plan-test-cases

This repository contains sample instances of Rate Plan data conforming to the Rate Plan Schema defined here: https://github.com/Flux-Tailor/rate-plan-schema/

The test case XML should be validated against rate-plan-schema releases, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flux-Tailor/rate-plan-schema/refs/tags/v0.9/<schema.xsd>.

This is a work in progress and are not yet finalized.
